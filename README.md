# TwitchTV-Toxicity-Profiling
#### A profiling analysis of online toxicity and sentiment of twitch chat at twitch.tv

Hello! Welcome to my ongoing, continuous project attempting to explore answers to random questions that pop into my head regarding the Twitch.tv online community.

I've spent a lot of my life in internet communities, having started as early as elementary school, playing browser-based RPG games like Neopets, GaiaOnline, and SoliaOnline. From there, my love of gaming continued to grow, as well as my involvement in online communities/forums like SmashBoards (Super Smash Bros Melee), BasilMarket (Maplestory), Reddit, Twitch, and more. Honestly, I attribute a lot of my personal growth and social development to my exploration and interactions within online communities, and so thinking about how to make these communities more accessible, welcoming, and inclusive, has always been a background process in my brain. I'm so grateful for the companionship, relationships, and openness of these online communities for giving me a chance to interact and explore during my awkward kid and teenage years. It is my hope that maybe one day these insights might be valuable for improving the current state of online toxicity/hate, as well as providing guidance to improve moderation of such behavior.

I plan to leverage my technical skills in data analytics, as well as including my own personal psychosociological perspective to analyze why this online culture has evolved, and brainstorm methods to improve the current state of regulation and moderation.

Thank you for stopping by! Much love.
